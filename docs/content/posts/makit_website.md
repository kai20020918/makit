## üëÄ Overview

This is a simple yet powerful CLI tool that lets you **create files and directories simultaneously** with a single command.  
No more typing `mkdir` followed by `touch`‚Äîthis utility streamlines your workflow and boosts productivity, especially for developers and script writers

## ü•û Usage

`makit` is a powerful CLI tool that simplifies file and directory creation. Once installed, you can use it from any directory in your terminal.

makit [OPTION] <FILES|DIRS...>
**Options:**

- `-p` Create parent directories as needed (default)
- `-m <mode>` Set directory permissions (e.g., -m 755)
- `-d <stamp>` Use specific timestamp (e.g., 202504181200)
- `-c` Do not create file if it doesn‚Äôt exist
- `-v` Enable verbose output
- `-h` print this message.

**Examples:**

- **Create a single file:**

  ```bash
  makit my_new_file.txt
  ```

  This creates `my_new_file.txt` in the current directory.

- **Create a directory:**

  ```bash
  makit my_new_directory/
  ```

  This creates `my_new_directory/` in the current directory.

- **Create a file within a new nested directory:**

  ```bash
  makit project/src/main.go
  ```

  This creates `project/` and `project/src/` directories, then `main.go` inside `src/`.

- **Create multiple files and directories at once:**

  ```bash
  makit client/index.html server/app.js docs/README.md
  ```

- **Create a directory with specific permissions (e.g., 700):**

  ```bash
  makit -m 700 private_data/
  ```

- **Create a file with a specific timestamp:**

  ```bash
  makit -d 202506201800 meeting_notes.txt
  ```

- **Attempt to create an existing file (with -c):**

  ```bash
  # Assuming 'existing_file.txt' already exists
  makit -c existing_file.txt
  # Output: Exists: existing_file.txt

  # Assuming 'non_existent_file.txt' does NOT exist
  makit -c non_existent_file.txt
  # Output: Skipped (not created): non_existent_file.txt
  ```

## üçà Installation

To use `makit` from any directory in your terminal, you need to place the `makit` executable in a directory that is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.

**Steps:**

1.  **Build the `makit` executable:**
    Navigate to the root directory of your `makit` project (where `go.mod` is located) and build the application:

    ```bash
    go build -o makit cmd/main/makit.go
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `makit` in your current directory.

2.  **Move the executable to a `PATH` directory:**
    Move the `makit` executable to a common system binary directory, such as `/usr/local/bin/`. This usually requires superuser (sudo) privileges:

    ```bash
    sudo mv makit /usr/local/bin/
    ```

3.  **Verify the installation:**
    Open a new terminal window (or run `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh) and try running `makit` without `./`:
    ```bash
    makit -h
    ```
    If you see the help message, `makit` is successfully installed and ready to use!
