### Origin of Name

    The name makit is a blend of:

      make – representing the action of creating files and directories, inspired by traditional UNIX tools like make, mkdir, and touch.

      it – referring to “it”, the thing you want to create. Whether it’s a file, a folder, or an entire structure—just makit.
